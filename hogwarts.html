                    Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, often shortened to Hogwarts, was the British wizarding school, located in the Scottish Highlands. It accepted 
                    magical students from Great Britain and Ireland for enrolment. It was a state-owned school, funded by the Ministry of Magic. <br><br>

                    The precise location of the school could never be uncovered because it was rendered Unplottable. To Muggles, the school appeared to be an old, abandoned castle. 
                    Similarly, most wizarding schools' locations were protected in order to prevent their ways of teaching being revealed, as well as protect the students and schools 
                    themselves from any harm. <br><br>

                    Established around the 10th century, Hogwarts was considered to be one of the finest magical institutions in the wizarding world, though other notable schools 
                    included Beauxbatons Academy of Magic in France, the Durmstrang Institute implied to be in northern Europe, and Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in 
                    the United States. <br><br>

                    Children with magical abilities were enrolled at birth, and acceptance was confirmed by owl post at age eleven. However, if the child in question was a Muggle-born 
                    or a half-blood like Harry Potter with no knowledge of the wizarding world, a staff member from the school visited the child and his or her family in order to 
                    inform them of their magical heritage and the existence of the wizarding world. <br><br>

                    The school's motto was Draco Dormiens Nunquam Titillandus (Draco Dormiens Nvnqvam Titillandvs), which, translated from Latin, means "Never tickle a sleeping 
                    dragon".

                    <i>"Quidditch, the most popular sport in the magical world – highly dangerous, very exciting and played on broomsticks."</i>— Description
                </p>

                <p class="quid_para">
                    Quidditch (formerly known as Kwidditch and Cuaditch) was a wizarding sport played on broomsticks. It was the most popular game and most well-known game among 
                    wizards and witches, and, according to Rubeus Hagrid, the equivalent to Muggles' passion for football (Soccer). <br> <br>

                    The object of the game was to score more points than your opponents. Each goal was worth ten points and catching the Golden Snitch was worth one-hundred and 
                    fifty points. The game ended when the Snitch was caught or an agreement was reached between the captains of both teams. Some games could go on for many days 
                    if the Snitch was not caught (the record, according to Quidditch Through the Ages, was six months, although no one caught the Snitch). <br> <br>
                </p>

                <p class="q_sub"><b><u>Quidditch Pitches :-</u></b></p>

                <p class="quid_para">Quidditch pitches were typically in the shape of an oval, five-hundred feet long and one-hundred and eighty feet wide, with a small central circle of approximately 
                    two feet in diameter, from which all the balls were released at the start of the game. At each end there were three hooped goal posts of different heights, 
                    surrounded by a scoring area. As Quidditch is an aerial sport, Quidditch pitches usually feature spectator seating at high vantage points, whether in towers 
                    (such as at Hogwarts) or in a fully-encircling platform style (such as the British stadium that held the 1994 Quidditch World Cup). <br> <br>

                    The three hooped goal posts were originally barrel-goals, introduced during Goodwin Kneen's time. At the time of the introduction of the scoring area, they were 
                    replaced by baskets on stilts, but whilst these were practical, they did carry an inherent problem: there was no size restriction on the baskets, which differed 
                    dramatically from pitch to pitch.
