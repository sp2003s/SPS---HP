            An <b>Invisibility Cloak</b> was a magical garment which rendered whomever or whatever it covered invisible. Invisibility cloaks were exceptionally rare and valuable within the wizarding world.

            <p class="intro">
                Most invisibility cloaks wore out over time, eventually becoming visible. In addition, cloaks were vulnerable to damage from spells. <br><br>

                A notable exception to these unwritten rules was the fabled Cloak of Invisibility, a Deathly Hallow that never seemed to waver in its ability and resisted spells, despite its immense age. According to Albus Dumbledore: <i>“True Invisibility Cloaks, though rare, exist in this world of ours; however, the story makes it clear that Death’s Cloak is of a uniquely durable nature….”.</i>

              — Mad-Eye Moody was in possession of an invisibility cloak
            </p>

            <p class="intro">
              Invisibility cloaks had existed since the 13th century, with typical invisibility cloaks having been available since at least the 20th century. <br><br>

              Jacob's sibling also gained ownership of an invisibility cloak in the 1989–1990 school year. The cloak was originally Alistair Fidgen's, but he gained possession of it by trading a love potion for it. Jacob's sibling used their cloak to spy on various staff members and professors, such as Professor Binns, Madam Pince, Professor Kettleburn, Rubeus Hagrid, Professor McGonagall and Professor Flitwick. They and Mundungus Fletcher later used their invisibility cloaks at the end of the school year to spy on Merula Snyde speaking to a Dark Witch in Knockturn Alley, where they watched her being initiated into 'R' by the Dark Witch and then Disapparate. <br><br>

              Alastor Moody owned two invisibility cloaks, lending ones to Mundungus Fletcher and Sturgis Podmore. Barty Crouch Snr owned a cloak as well, hiding Barty Crouch Jnr under one when helping him escape Azkaban. He was then forced to wear the cloak in the house when he was controlled by Barty Crouch Snr under the Imperius Curse. Barty Jnr would make use of this cloak when he returned to Lord Voldemort's services, keeping himself hidden to intercept and assassinate his father. <br><br>

              It is also known that Arthur Weasley hid under one while on guard duty at the Ministry of Magic. The members of the Order of the Phoenix also used invisibility cloaks to hide themselves as they stood guard over Harry in Privet Drive. <br>

                — Harry Potter receiving the Cloak of Invisibility as a Christmas present
              </p>
              <p class="intro">
                The Tale of the Three Brothers, a wizarding legend, speaks of a Cloak of Invisibility which Xenophilius Lovegood characterised as one which "endures eternally, giving constant and impenetrable concealment, no matter what spells are cast at it." <br><br>

                According to the legend, Ignotus Peverell was given the cloak by Death in the 13th century as a reward for having bested him. However, in his introduction to The Tales of Beetle the Bard, Albus Dumbledore speculated that its more likely that Ignotus and his brothers were highly talented wizards who created the Hallows themselves. Whatever the truth, the cloak became a family heirloom and was inherited by Ignotus' descendants, including James Potter and eventually his son, Harry Potter who was given it as a gift on Christmas day 1991. <br><br>

                In 1997, Ron Weasley was the first to speculate that Harry's cloak was the cloak of legend, since it was still in perfect condition despite being at least two generations old. Other invisibility cloaks of similar age would have worn out or, at least, become less effective yet Harry's remained as good as new. Ordinary cloaks would have, over time, become visible, ripped, had their enchantments worn off, or had been countered with other spells. <br><br>

                Harry's son James Sirius Potter inherited the Cloak of Invisibility. His younger brother Albus Severus stole it from James when he needed to hide from bullies, or from Professor McGonagall.
